# CryptoFier

An application using this user can hide and encrypt the sensitive data/files
into JPG/JPEG images. A popular way for people to protect their file is encryption, using
programs like 7 ZIP (http://www.7-zip.org/) to prevent unauthorized access to data. The
only problem with encryption is it is typically obvious that a file is encrypted. Steganography
is a different method of preventing unauthorized access of data and files that solve that
problem. What steganography does is it allows you to do is hide within other files. For
example, you can hide a Word File inside a JPG image. On the outside the JPG image is a
normal JPG image; it even opens and is viewing like a JPG image. However, under the JPG
image is hidden Word file which can be extracted by the people who know it is there.

## Techincal Details

1. Using Steganography we are hiding the files within other files (i.e. text in the JPG).
2. Cryptographic protocols we intended to use are Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
and RSA for encrypting the sensitive data.

## Applications
We all have files that we’d like to hide because of the security reasons. Some of us hide
these files in deep obscure folders like the windows system folder and rename them along
with their extensions. Some of us get incredibly creative. We change the icon and rename
into a program that no one really uses, but some of us take more rational approaches like
encrypting the file. For those of us who lack any creativity, time or impressive memories,
there’s our software CRYPTOFIER.
